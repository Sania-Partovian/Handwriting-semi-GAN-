# Project description

We want to code a semi supervised Generative Adversarial Network on Mnist dataset. Labeled data are time and cost consuming so we have little labeled data here and the rest of training data are unlabeled. At the end network classifies data to 11 classes. (class 0 to 9 and fake) 

We have only 100 labeled data.

Conclution:

We can see semi supervised GAN produce good classification result in comparison with supervised learning method with less labeled data.
